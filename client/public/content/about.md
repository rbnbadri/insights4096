## ⚠️ A Quick Note on Opening Variations

Chess.com allows filtering by opening **families**, but **not by specific variations**. For instance, while you can filter games by *Queen’s Pawn Opening*, you cannot directly filter by *Queen’s Pawn Opening: Zukertort Variation*.  
So, clicking a link for a specific variation’s "won games" might include nearby or related positions.  
To work around this, we provide **PGN download support** — you can download only the games that match your chosen **variation + result** combination for precise study.
